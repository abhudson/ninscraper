# ninscraper
Site scraper and Twitter DMer.

When run as a pre-minute cron job, this script used to check the Nintendo Australia "Club Nintendo" site for new offers, and send a twitter direct message to me and my friends as soon as something new became available.

The site no longer exists, but the scraping logic could be easily changed to work with a different site.
